  Scenario: User needs to be able to search for a case by postcode
    Given the SEL user receives a phone call from a respondent
    When they enter a postcode
    Then all address are returned for the postcode

  @sus002-02
  Scenario: User is to be informed if we do not hold the postcode that has been entered
    Given the user enters a postcode that doesnt exist in the sample
    When the internal user searches for that postcode
    Then no postcodes/addresses are to be returned
