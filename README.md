# rasrm-acceptance-tests
System / API tests for RAS & RM services

## Prerequisites
1. Install [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
1. Install [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)


## Running the tests

To override any environment variables you should export any variables before running the tests with behave e.g. `export HEADLESS=False` or by creating a local `.env` file. Most of the environment variables are defined in [config.py](config.py)

### Headless
```bash
pipenv install --dev
make test
```

### Not headless
```bash
export HEADLESS=False  # or =True for Chrome in headless mode
pipenv install --dev
make test
```


### Commands
```bash
make start_services  # Brings all the services up using Docker
make setup  # Prepares data for acceptance tests
make style_tests  # Will check for Flake8 errors
make system_tests  # Will run the system tests
make acceptance_tests  # Will run the acceptance tests not yet converted to run in parallel
make acceptance_parallel_tests  # Will run the acceptance tests converted to run in parallel
make stop_services  # Bring down all the Docker services
make test  # Will bring all the services up and run all the tests
make TEST_TARGET=acceptance_tests/features/your.feature run_tests # Runs a single feature file WITHOUT 'make setup' first
make TEST_TARGET=acceptance_tests/features/your.feature acceptance_tests # Runs a single feature file WITH 'make setup' first
MAKE_TARGET: secure_messaging_acceptance_tests # Runs secure messaging tests
```


### Config
Config is set by environment variables in [config.py](config.py)

If any config is updated it also has to be updated in the Jenkinsfile


### Debugging tests in Pycharm
1. Set the environment variable in pycharm HEADLESS=FALSE. Some instructions to do that https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/python-console.html
1. If running against another environment set any other host environment variables in pycharm
1. Stick a breakpoint at the point you want to debug
1. Debug the `run.py` and wait to hit the breakpoint

### Debugging tests against services deployed in Cloudfoundry
1. Set Cloudfoundry database environment variables
    ```bash
    export CLOUDFOUNDRY_API=
    export CLOUDFOUNDRY_EMAIL=
    export CLOUDFOUNDRY_PASSWORD=
    export CLOUDFOUNDRY_ORG=
    export CLOUDFOUNDRY_SPACE=
    ```
1. Get database environment variables `curl -fsSL  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ONSdigital/ras-deploy/master/scripts/get_database_uris.sh |bash|sed -e 's/@.*:5432/@localhost:5432/g' > setenvs.sh`
1. Get database URI `export DATABASE_NAME=$(cf apps | grep ras-collection-instrument-ci | awk '{ print "cf env "$1 }' | bash | grep "postgres://" | awk -F \" '{ print $4 }' | sed 's!postgres://.*@\(.*\):.*!\1!')`
1. Create an SSH tunnel to the database `cf ssh -L 5432:$DATABASE_NAME:5432 ras-collection-instrument-ci`
cloudfoundry app name of a service that has a dependency on the database.
1. Set environment variables in shell `fly -t ons get-pipeline -p rasrm|sed '1,/task: rasrm\-acceptance\-tests/d;/on_failure/,$d'|sed -e '1,3d; s/\"//g'|sed -e 's/\:\ /=/g'|awk '{print "export "$1 }' >> setenvs.sh`
1. Set database environment variables `source setenvs.sh`
1. Reset data in cloudfoundry `make setup`
1. Run tests `pipenv run python run.py`

Note. To run in pycharm you'll need to put the same environment variables in
1. Copy the environment variables from the concourse pipeline `cat setenvs.sh|awk '{ print $2 }'|pbcopy`
1. Open run configuration for `run.py` by clicking Edit Configuration...
1. Open the environment variables by clicking the ...
1. Click the paste icon

### Troubleshooting
#### Failing tests
##### Setup data
The tests may be failing because you have teared down postgres recently
1. Run `make setup` which will reload any data required for the tests
##### Stale images
If you've got an old image hanging around it could cause failures. There are two things to try
1. Firstly run `make pull` within tmp_ras_rm_docker_dev and then re-run `make test`
2. Secondly if that doesn't work run `docker kill $(docker ps -qa) ; docker rm $(docker ps -qa) ; docker rmi $(docker images -qa)` to delete all images and then re-run `make test`
