# Running the tests

To override any environmental variables you should export any variables before running the tests with behave e.g. `export HEADLESS=False`.
The environmental variables are defined in [config.py](config.py)

### Headless
```bash
npm install -g phantomjs-prebuilt 
pipenv install --dev
pipenv run behave system_tests/features # This will only run the system tests
pipenv run behave acceptance_tests/features # This will only run the acceptance tests
```

### Chrome
```bash
export HEADLESS=False
pipenv install --dev
pipenv run behave system_tests/features # This will only run the system tests
pipenv run behave acceptance_tests/features # This will only run the acceptance tests
```
